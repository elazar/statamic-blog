I ran into an issue recently while trying to run PHPUnit tests in an environment using XHProf. Google didn't prove to be much help, so I thought I'd document the problem and solution here for posterity.

When I ran my tests, each failed with the same cryptic error and no backtrace.

```none
Attempted to serialize unserializable builtin class PDO
```

The cause was the culmination of two rather unfortunate circumstances.

First, XHProf uses a global array variable to contain its configuration in its [`auto_prepend_file`](https://github.com/staabm/xhprof.io/blob/master/inc/prepend.php), which includes a [`PDO`](http://php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php) instance. Yet another reason to add to the list of [reasons why global variables are bad](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?GlobalVariablesAreBad).

Second, PHPUnit has a setting called [`@backupGlobals`](https://phpunit.de/manual/current/en/appendixes.annotations.html#appendixes.annotations.backupGlobals) that is enabled by default. For reasons of which I'm uncertain, the [library used for this](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/global-state) applies and reverses serialization to variables in the global state for the purpose of creating a snapshot of it.

The [method used for detecting serializability](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/global-state/blob/1.1.1/src/Snapshot.php#L403-L422) in this library unfortunately doesn't presently detect that `PDO` can't be serialized when an instance of it is contained within a global array variable. As a result, when PHPUnit attempts to snapshot the global state after a test has run and it encounters the `PDO` instance from the XHProf configuration, the error above is the result.

There appears to be a [pull request](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/global-state/pull/3) with changes to this serializability detection, though I can't speak to whether it would improve it or cover the use case causing this problem. I've filed a [related issue](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/global-state/issues/8) against the appropriate repo. Until it's addressed, I'd recommend either disabling [`@backupGlobals`](https://phpunit.de/manual/current/en/appendixes.annotations.html#appendixes.annotations.backupGlobals) in your `phpunit.xml` file or disabling XHProf when running PHPUnit tests.

Hope this helps someone else. Thanks for reading!
