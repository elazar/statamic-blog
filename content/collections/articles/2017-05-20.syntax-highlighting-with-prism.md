After completing a minimal initial iteration of this web site, I began examining what features it still lacked. Among these was syntax highlighting for enhanced readability of code samples. I've evaluated several libraries for this purpose over the years: [SyntaxHighlighter](http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/), [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/), [Rainbow](http://rainbowco.de), and more recently [Prism](http://prismjs.com).

In this instance, I decided to use Prism, for a few reasons.

1. At 2.4 KB, it has a fairly lean core.
2. It has separate files for specific languages that are also fairly small. The one for PHP is a mere 968 bytes when minified.
3. It supports display of [line numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_number) via a [plugin](http://prismjs.com/plugins/line-numbers/), a feature that is also supported in [SyntaxHighlighter](http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/manual/demo/gutter.html) and [Rainbow](https://github.com/ccampbell/rainbow#more-info) but not in [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/line-numbers.html).
4. It supports on-demand autoloading of syntax and stylesheet files for individual languages via a [plugin](http://prismjs.com/plugins/autoloader/) that requires very little setup or configuration.
5. It has a number of other [useful plugins](http://prismjs.com/plugins/).
6. It supports multiple color themes implemented using CSS.
7. It is available on [CDNJS](https://cdnjs.com/), which removes the need for me to build or host it myself.

Implementing use of Prism involved making a few additions to my [layout template](https://github.com/elazar/scribing#layout-template).

First, I had to include two CSS files, one for the color theme and another for the line numbers plugin.

```markup
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/prism/1.6.0/themes/prism-twilight.min.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/prism/1.6.0/plugins/line-numbers/prism-line-numbers.min.css">
```

Second, I had to include three JS files: one for the Prism core, one for the line numbers plugin, and one for the autoloader plugin.

```markup
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/prism/1.6.0/components/prism-core.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/prism/1.6.0/plugins/line-numbers/prism-line-numbers.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/prism/1.6.0/plugins/autoloader/prism-autoloader.min.js"></script>
```

Finally, I had to provide a bit of JS to set a base path for autoloaded language files and to enable the line numbers plugin.

```javascript
Prism.plugins.autoloader.languages_path = 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/prism/1.6.0/components/';
Prism.hooks.add('before-highlight', function(env) {
    env.element.className += ' line-numbers';
});
```

The [CommonMark standard](http://commonmark.org/) supports what it calls [info strings](http://spec.commonmark.org/0.27/#info-string) in fenced code blocks, which can be used to (among other things) [designate the language](http://spec.commonmark.org/0.27/#example-110) of the code within the block. The library I use to produce HTML from Markdown, [`league/commonmark`](http://commonmark.thephpleague.com), generates HTML for info strings in a way that is conveniently consistent with how the Prism autoloader searches for code samples to highlight.

Overall, Prism offered a fairly easily implemented solution to produce aesthetically pleasing and readable code samples as a [progressive enhancement](https://alistapart.com/article/understandingprogressiveenhancement).
