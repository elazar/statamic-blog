After I [recently launched the new look](/2021/04/29/a-new-look/) for this web site, I noticed something interesting about my traffic: a lot of `404` responses for `/feed` or `/feed.xml`.

```bash
grep feed /var/log/nginx/access.log | grep -v Mozilla | grep -ahoE '"[^"]+"$' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
```

I originally suspected that the feed from my old site wasn't in wide use, so I didn't bother porting it over when I migrated the site. However, the new site launch provided traffic that disproved my suspicion. So, I decided to bring the feed back.

But now that the new site was using [Statamic](https://statamic.dev), I wasn't sure of the best way to go about it. I had to do some research to come up with a solution and thought I'd take a post to discuss the particulars.

## No Luck with Addons

A cursory search turned up [an addon](https://github.com/edalzell/statamic-feed) that, upon closer inspection, turned out to be for Statamic 2, where I'm using Statamic 3.

I found and joined the [Statamic Discord](https://statamic.com/discord) and ended up speaking to the author of that addon, who linked me to a [partially done port for Statamic 3](https://github.com/edalzell/statamic-feeds).

I wasn't able to get this port to work and filed a few issues against its repository. The author encouraged me to submit pull requests or create my own fork, but with [related documentation for extending Statamic](https://statamic.dev/extending) being on the sparse side, I suspected that was more effort than I wanted to invest.

## A Laravel Solution

The solution I settled on, while not as easily reusable as I would like, will work well enough as an interim measure until I can figure out how to convert it into an addon.

Statamic is built on Laravel, so I opted to pull the [`spatie/laravel-feed`](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-feed) Laravel package into my web site project.

Per the package's installation instructions, I added a call to its `Route::feeds()` macro to the `routes/web.php` file.

When I tried to publish the config file, I received this error: `Unable to locate publishable resources.` However, it turns out this wasn't necessary and I was able to manually copy the config file example from the package README to `config/feed.php`. The package worked fine once I had configured it properly.

## The Configuration

Getting this configuration right took some digging through source code and [`dd()`](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/helpers#method-dd) calls. I'm using the [Cool Writings starter kit](https://github.com/statamic/starter-kit-cool-writings), but you should be able to tweak this to work with your installation.

```php
<?php

use Spatie\Feed\FeedItem;
use Statamic\Entries\Entry;
use Statamic\Facades\User;

return [
    'feeds' => [
        'main' => [
            'items' => fn() => Entry::query()
                ->where('collection', 'articles')
                ->where('published', true)
                ->where('date', '<=', now())
                ->orderBy('date', 'desc')
                ->orderBy('title')
                ->limit(20)
                ->get()
                ->map(function(Entry $entry): FeedItem {
                    return FeedItem::create([
                        'id' => $entry->url(),
                        'title' => $entry->get('title'),
                        'summary' => $entry->excerpt ?? '',
                        'updated' => $entry->date(),
                        'link' => $entry->url(),
                        'author' => implode(', ', $entry->authors()->map(
                            fn($id) => User::find($id)->name
                        )->all()),
                    ]);
                }),
            'url' => '/feed.xml',
            'title' => 'Matthew Turland',
            'description' => 'Blog posts from matthewturland.com',
            'language' => 'en-US',
            'view' => 'feed::feed',
        ],
    ],
];
```

This fetches the 20 most recent published entries with a date on or before today and converts them into `FeedItem` instances that the `spatie/laravel-feed` package can then render as feed entries.

## Feed Links

Now that I had a rendering feed, I needed to link to it in the `<head>` tag of my [Antlers](https://statamic.dev/antlers) [layout template](https://statamic.dev/views#layouts).

Unfortunately, `spatie/laravel-feed` uses [Blade](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/blade), the Cool Writings starter kit templates use Antlers, and it turns out [it's not possible to embed Blade templates in Antlers templates](https://statamic.com/forum/4208-include-blade-partial-in-antlers-template#reply-16712), so I wasn't able to use the view macro provided by `spatie/laravel-feed`.

However, adding this snippet of markup to my layout template seemed to do the trick.

```markup
{{ foreach:config:feed.feeds as="feed" }}
<link rel="alternate" type="{{ feed.type ?? 'application/atom+xml' }}" href="{{ feed.url }}" title="{{ feed.title }}">
{{ /foreach:config:feed.feeds }}
```

## Static Generation

I'm using [`statamic/ssg`](https://github.com/statamic/ssg) to generate a static build of my site, which is what you're viewing now.

By default, this addon doesn't generate static versions of [routes](
https://github.com/statamic/ssg#routes) like the one that `spatie/laravel-feed` creates for the feed.

To include this route in the build process, I had to open `config/statamic/ssg.php` and modify the array it returns to include this segment.

```php
<?php

return [
	'urls' => [
		'/feed.xml',
	],

	// ...
];
```

Ideally, this would dynamically pull in all defined feeds, but I haven't been successful in accessing content or configuration from other addons from the `statamic/ssg` configuration. Hopefully, this is a shortcoming that I can address in an addon.

Lastly, the base URL for links needs to be set in configuration for it to be correct in the static build. I found the relevant setting in `config/app.php`.

```php
<?php

return [

    // ...

    // Commented this out
    // 'url' => env('APP_URL', 'http://localhost'),

    // Added this
    'url' => 'https://matthewturland.com',

    // ...

];
```

## Some Finishing Touches

One drawback of `statamic/ssg` is that the static output of the `/feed.xml` route is actually written to `/feed.xml/index.html` with no option to customize the destination.

To address this, I tacked some additional commands onto the `build` script in my `composer.json` file to move the file to the correct path in the build.

```bash
mv ./storage/app/static/feed.xml/index.html /tmp/feed.xml
rm -fR ./storage/app/static/feed.xml
mv /tmp/feed.xml ./storage/app/static/feed.xml
```

Lastly, in order to allow `/feed` to resolve as well as `/feed.xml`, I added a [`rewrite` directive](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/tutorials/config_pitfalls/#taxing-rewrites) to my nginx configuration.

```
rewrite ^/feed/?$ /feed.xml permanent;
```

## Epilogue

I hope that the Statamic community grows and that the barrier to entry for extending it becomes lower over time.

That said, I'm glad I was at least able to hack together a working solution for those accessing my content via feeds in the meantime. 

I hope you found this post useful, or at least interesting. Thanks for reading!
