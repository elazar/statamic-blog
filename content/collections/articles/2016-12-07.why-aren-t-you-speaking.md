Earlier today, I [asked on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/elazar/status/806628010568859648) why technical
conference attendees hadn't been a speaker at a conference themselves. Here are
a few of the responses and my advice.

> I haven't been willing and able to spend the prep time I feel that would deserve.

All I can say to this is, [budget your
time](https://24daysindecember.net/2016/12/07/on-finding-time/). If it's
important, you'll make the time for it. All speakers have to. While speaking
may not be for everyone, I do highly recommend giving it a try at least once.

> Stage fright. Lack of competence (or [impostor
> syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome)). Thinking my
> areas of expertise wouldn't appeal to others. Basically, fear.

> Not feeling I am enough of an expert or knowledgeable on a topic to get up and
> speak. (CFPs can be intimidating too.)

> Speaking for 45min-1hr is intimidating; didn't have subject I'm confident in

> My talk submissions have not been accepted, likely because I lack local practice.

Perceived lack of expertise comes from the [Dunning-Kruger
effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect),
specifically the aspect of when a relative (to the audience) expert
underestimates the extent of their own knowledge. It's a cognitive bias that
has to be overcome.

The same applies to stage fright. I've seen people who would quite literally
faint at the prospect of speaking in front of a group overcome their fear and
go on to become great speakers. It takes practice and repeated effort, but it
can be done.

There are a few ways to dip your toes in the pool of speaking:

* Start by writing a blog post or article for a site like [SitePoint](https://www.sitepoint.com/write-for-us/) or a magazine like [php[architect]](https://www.phparch.com/editorial/write-for-us/) about the topics you're considering speaking about. In addition to helping you build knowledge and practice presenting it off-stage, these can help you build credentials as someone familiar with the relevant subject matter.
* When speaking, start small. Give a lightning talk for a group like [Nomad PHP](https://nomadphp.com/category/lightning-talks/), which has a significantly shorter length than one for a conference. Attend a conference that hosts an [unconference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference) and volunteer to give a shorter talk there. Volunteer to speak at a local user group or your local [Toastmasters](https://www.toastmasters.org/) chapter.
* Need help developing your conference abstracts? Use a site like [HelpMeAbstract](http://helpmeabstract.com) to get help from successful speakers or use a site like [PHP Mentoring](http://www.php-mentoring.org/) to find someone who can provide more one-on-one help.
* Read my [post on speaking resources](http://matthewturland.com/2014/07/15/speaking-resources/) for help when you're ready to start submitting to conferences and how to handle preparing when you get accepted.
* Don't let rejections discourage you. It can take a while to get accepted. Be persistent. Try to improve your proposals, write new ones, and keep on submitting.

If you've spoken at a conference before, what are your tips for prospective or
first-time speakers? If you haven't, why not?
