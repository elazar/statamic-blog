I recently made a contribution to the [PHPUnit](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/ "PHPUnit") project that I thought I'd take a blog post to discuss. One of the extensions bundled with PHPUnit adds support for [database testing](http://www.phpunit.de/manual/3.4/en/database.html "Chapter 9. Database Testing"). This extension was contributed by [Mike Lively](http://www.ds-o.com/ "Digital Sandwich") and is a port of the [DbUnit](http://www.dbunit.org/components.html "DbUnit - Core Components") extension for the [JUnit](http://www.junit.org/ "Welcome to JUnit.org! | JUnit.org") Java unit testing framework. If you're interested in learning more about database unit testing, check out [this presentation](http://sebastian-bergmann.de/archives/773-Testing-PHPMySQL-Applications-with-PHPUnitDbUnit.html "Testing PHP/MySQL Applications with PHPUnit/DbUnit  - Sebastian Bergmann") by [Sebastian Bergmann](http://sebastian-bergmann.de/ "Sebastian Bergmann  - Sebastian Bergmann") on the subject.

One of the major components of both extensions is the data set. Database unit tests involve loading a seed data set into a database, executing code that performs an operation on that data set such as deleting a record, and then checking the state of the data set to confirm that the operation had the desired effect. DbUnit supports [multiple formats](http://www.dbunit.org/components.html "DbUnit - Core Components") for seed data sets. The PHPUnit Database extension includes [support](http://www.phpunit.de/manual/3.4/en/database.html#database.datasets "Chapter 9. Database Testing") for DbUnit's XML and flat XML formats plus CSV format as well.

If you're using [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/ "MySQL :: The world's most popular open source database") as your database, CSV has been the only format supported by both the [mysqldump](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/mysqldump.html#option_mysqldump_fields "MySQL :: MySQL 5.0 Reference Manual :: 4.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") utility and the PHPUnit Database extension up to this point. My contribution adds support for its [XML format](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/mysqldump.html#option_mysqldump_xml "MySQL :: MySQL 5.0 Reference Manual :: 4.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") to the extension. While this support was developed to work in the PHPUnit 3.4.x branch, it won't be available in a stable release until 3.5.0. In the meantime, this is how you can use it now.

1. Go to the [commit](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/commit/fad913fd84720f889e1d3415e775f68304e76f52 "Commit fad913fd84720f889e1d3415e775f68304e76f52 to elazar's phpunit - GitHub") on Github and apply the additions and modifications included in it to your PHPUnit installation.
2. From a shell, get your XML seed data set and store it in a location accessible to your unit test cases.

    ```bash
    mysqldump --xml -t -u username -p database > seed.xml
    ```

3. Create a test case class that extends `PHPUnit_Extensions_Database_TestCase`. Implement `getConnection()` and `getDataSet()` as per the documentation where the latter will include a method call to create the data set from the XML file as shown below.

    ```php
    $dataSet = $this->createMySQLXMLDataSet('/path/to/seed.xml');
    ```

4. At this point, you can execute operations on the database to get it to its expected state following a test, produce an XML dump of the database in that state, and then compare that dump to the actual database contents in a test method to confirm that the two are equal.

    ```php
    $expected = $this->createMySQLXMLDataSet('/path/to/expected.xml');

    // Specify a SELECT query as the 2nd parameter here to limit the data set,
    // else the entire table is used
    $actual = new PHPUnit_Extension_Database_DataSet_QueryDataSet($this->getConnection());
    $actual->addTable('tablename');
    $this->assertDataSetsEqual($expected, $actual);
    ```

That's it! Hopefully this proves useful to [someone else](http://twitter.com/trevor_morse/status/7239323093 "Twitter / Trevor Morse: @elazar OMG, yes! I've bee ..."). 

**Update #1** 2012/01/15: I finally got around to submitting a patch to document this feature in the PHPUnit manual. Sebastian has [merged it](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit-documentation/pull/45 "#45: Added a section on MySQL XML datasets to the Database Testing chapter by elazar for sebastianbergmann/phpunit-documentation - Pull Request - GitHub"), so it will hopefully be available in the online manual soon.

**Update #2** 2012/01/23: I got around to checking the online version of the manual and the current build [includes my patch](http://www.phpunit.de/manual/current/en/database.html#mysql-xml-dataset "Chapter 8. Database Testing"). Enjoy.
