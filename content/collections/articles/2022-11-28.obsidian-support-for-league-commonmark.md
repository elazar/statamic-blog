I've been using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) for some months now for [personal knowledge management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management), among other things.

One of those other things is keeping notes for a [Werewolf: The Forsaken 2E](http://theonyxpath.com/werewolf-the-forsaken-products/) game that I play in every couple of weeks. We reached a point in the game where I became the designated note-taker for the group. However, none of the others use Obsidian, which it made it a bit difficult to share my notes with them in a user-friendly form.

I'd used the [`league/commonmark`](https://commonmark.thephpleague.com/) package to build the [previous iteration](/2017/05/13/a-fresh-start/) of the site you're reading now. I wondered if I couldn't leverage it again to create a solution for this present predicament.

Initially, I wrote a quick-and-dirty script that transformed the Markdown source file contents prior to using `league/commonmark` to convert them to HTML. However, that solution was fairly hacky and its output wasn't very good in some cases.

A quick skim of [Packagist results](https://packagist.org/packages/league/commonmark?type=commonmark-extension) for a better solution didn't yield anything specific to my use case, so I took it upon myself to write my own [extension](https://commonmark.thephpleague.com/2.3/customization/extensions/) for `league/commonmark`: [`elazar/league-commonmark-obsidian`](https://github.com/elazar/league-commonmark-obsidian). (In the process, I even managed to submit a [small fix](https://github.com/thephpleague/commonmark/pull/949) to related `league/commonmark` documentation that was merged!)

In addition to the extension itself, the library includes a simple stock conversion script `./bin/obsidian-to-html` and a `Converter` class used by that script that can be used in custom conversion scripts for additional customization of the output.

While I suspect that this package has a rather niche audience, I hope it proves useful to someone else. I've already replaced my own script with one that uses this extension and I'm fairly happy with the results.
