I use [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/ "WordPress › Blog Tool, Publishing Platform, and CMS") for this web site. To pretty up source code examples in my posts, I use the excellent [SyntaxHighlighter Evolved](http://www.viper007bond.com/wordpress-plugins/syntaxhighlighter/ "SyntaxHighlighter Evolved « Viper007Bond.com") WordPress plugin. The WordPress theme I use, [Fluid Blue](http://srinig.com/wordpress/themes/fluid-blue/ "Fluid Blue « Srini's WordPress Lab"), does something with its CSS such that it and SyntaxHighlighter appear to conflict. The result is that source code examples processed by the plugin are displayed with a font size that's too small to read comfortably.

In doing some digging, I learned about the [child themes](http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes "Child Themes « WordPress Codex") feature of WordPress, which allows you to effectively extend an existing theme. I created a directory under `wp-content/themes` called `fluid-blue-custom`. In this directory, I created a `styles.css` file with these contents:

```css
/*
Theme Name: Fluid Blue (Custom)
Template: fluid-blue
*/

@import url("../fluid-blue/style.css");

body .syntaxhighlighter code,
body .syntaxhighlighter .gutter {
    font-size: 12px !important;
}
```

The `Template` line of the comment block indicates that this theme is a child theme of the existing Fluid Blue theme that resides in the `wp-content/themes/fluid-blue` directory. The `@import` line pulls in the `styles.css` file from that directory, after which I can apply any CSS overrides I like. The last line is a CSS rule specific enough to override applicable rules from the parent theme in order to increase the font size to something more easily readable.

It appears [I'm not the only one](http://www.viper007bond.com/wordpress-plugins/syntaxhighlighter/comment-page-10/#comment-235530 "SyntaxHighlighter Evolved « Viper007Bond.com") who's encountered this issue, so I hope this post helps someone else.
