When I first began working with [`Zend_View`](https://framework.zend.com/manual/1.12/en/zend.view.html) on a project at work, I noticed that the [URL view helper](https://framework.zend.com/apidoc/1.12/classes/Zend_View_Helper_Url.html) was a bit of a pain to use. It was rare that I didn't want to specify one or more of the action, controller, and module in my call along with [the other Route assembly parameters](https://framework.zend.com/manual/1.12/en/zend.controller.router.html#zend.controller.router.routes.standard). Having to label them with an array index made the calls to the helper ugly and more difficult to read. As well, I often wanted to refer to actions in the same controller or controllers in the same module with respect to the current action.

To get around this, I wrote a view helper that extended `Zend_View_Helper_Url` and had three optional parameters specifically for the action, controller, and module. Everything else was passed into the fourth parameter, an associative array of any other parameters I needed to include. If any component of the route is excluded or specified as `null`, I simply get its value from the current request.

My friend [Andy Best](http://fishhead2567.wordpress.com/2008/07/08/extending-zend-url/) took this a step further and added in support for specifying custom routes, which he's using for a project of his own but I didn't need myself because I only use the default routes provided by the standard rewrite router. The result is the code below.

```php
<?php

require_once 'Zend/Controller/Front.php';
require_once 'Zend/View/Helper/Url.php';

class App_View_Helper_Route extends Zend_View_Helper_Url
{
    public function route($action = null, $controller = null, 
        $module = null, $params = array(), $route = null)
    {
        $front = Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance();
        $request = $front->getRequest();
        $router = $front->getRouter();
                                                
        if ($action === null) {
            $action = $request->getActionName();
        }
        if ($controller === null) {
			$controller = $request->getControllerName();
        }
        if ($module === null) {
            $module = $request->getModuleName();
        }

        $urlOptions = array_merge($params, array(
			'controller' => $controller,
            'module' => $module
		));

        if ($router->hasRoute($controller) && $route === null) {
            $route = $controller;
        } elseif ($route === null) {
            $route = 'default';
        }

        return $this->url($urlOptions, $route, true);
    }
}
```
