I'm currently working on a project that involves running [Drupal](http://drupal.org/ "Drupal - Open Source CMS | drupal.org") on [Amazon EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/ "Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)"). To save time in setting up future new VM instances, I decided to take the opportunity to learn [puppet](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/introduction.html "Documentation | Puppet Labs - Introduction to Puppet"). For the time being, I'm using a single VM to run the full LAMP stack and running puppet [without a server](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/#part-one-serverless-puppet "Documentation | Puppet Labs - Puppet Labs Documentation") by copying my puppet manifest to the VM and using [puppet's apply command](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/tools.html#puppet-apply-or-puppet "Documentation | Puppet Labs - Tools") to apply it locally. However, this manifest can easily be adapted for a multi-VM environment. After some tinkering, I came up with the code below.

```ruby
class web {
    package { 'httpd':
        ensure => 'present',
    }
    
    package { 'php':
        ensure => 'present',
    }
    
    # Update this to use your respective time zone value
    exec {
        'php_config': command => '/bin/sed -i "s/^;date.timezone =/date.timezone = \'America\/Chicago\'/g" /etc/php.ini',
        require => Package['php'],
    }
    
    service { 'httpd':
        ensure => 'running',
        enable => true,
        hasrestart => true,
        hasstatus => true,
        subscribe => Package['httpd', 'php'],
    }
    
    # Drupal requirements start here
    package { ['php-pdo', 'php-mysql', 'php-xml', 'php-gd', 'php-mbstring']:
        ensure => 'present',
        require => Package['php'],
    }
}

class mysql {
    package { 'mysql-server':
        ensure => 'present',
    }

    service { 'mysqld':
        ensure => 'running',
        enable => true,
        hasrestart => true,
        hasstatus => true,
        subscribe => Package['mysql-server'],
    }
    
    # Equivalent to /usr/bin/mysql_secure_installation without providing or setting a password
    exec { 'mysql_secure_installation':
        command => '/usr/bin/mysql -uroot -e "DELETE FROM mysql.user WHERE User=\'\'; DELETE FROM mysql.user WHERE User=\'root\' AND Host NOT IN (\'localhost\', \'127.0.0.1\', \'::1\'); DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS test; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;" mysql',
        require => Service['mysqld'],
    }
}

class {'web': }
class {'mysql': }
```

With this code saved to a file called `manifest.pp` (`.pp` being the file extension for puppet manifests), I can spin up a VM and do the following to set it up:

```bash
scp -i key.pem manifest.pp ec2-user@host:~/
ssh -i key.pem ec2-user@host
sudo yum upgrade -y
sudo yum install -y puppet
sudo puppet apply manifest.pp
rm -f manifest.pp
exit
```

At this point, I have a basic Apache/MySQL/PHP configuration capable of receiving a Drupal 7 installation.
