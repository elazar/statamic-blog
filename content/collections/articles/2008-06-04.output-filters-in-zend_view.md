A feature of [Zend Framework](http://framework.zend.com "Zend Framework") [MVC](https://framework.zend.com/manual/1.12/en/learning.quickstart.intro.html) that isn't currently very well documented is output filters. They're mentioned in passing in the [`Zend_View`](https://framework.zend.com/manual/1.12/en/zend.view.introduction.html) documentation, but not reviewed in detail anywhere in the Reference Guide as of version 1.5.2. I was curious enough about how to implement markup [minification](http://yuiblog.com/blog/2006/03/06/minification-v-obfuscation/ "Minification v Obfuscation - Yahoo! User Interface Blog") that I decided to trace through the `Zend_View` source code in attempt to discern how output filters actually worked. As it turns out, it's actually pretty simple.

First, you need to get a reference to the current `Zend_View` instance. If you're using the [`Zend_Layout`](https://framework.zend.com/manual/1.12/en/zend.layout.html) [MVC integration](https://framework.zend.com/manual/1.12/en/zend.layout.quickstart.html#zend.layout.quickstart.mvc), you can get this by calling `$this->`[`_helper`](https://framework.zend.com/apidoc/1.12/classes/Zend_Controller_Action.html#property__helper)`->`[`layout`](https://framework.zend.com/apidoc/1.12/classes/Zend_Layout_Controller_Action_Helper_Layout.html)`->`[`getLayoutInstance()`](https://framework.zend.com/apidoc/1.12/classes/Zend_Layout_Controller_Action_Helper_Layout.html#method_getLayoutInstance) within your `Zend_Controller_Action` class to get the current `Zend_Layout` instance and then [`getView()`](https://framework.zend.com/apidoc/1.12/classes/Zend_Layout.html#method_getView) on that to get your `Zend_View` instance. Otherwise, the `Zend_View` instance is available via the [`view`](https://framework.zend.com/apidoc/1.12/classes/Zend_Controller_Action.html#property_view) property of `Zend_Controller_Action` instance.

Next, call [`addFilterPath()`](https://framework.zend.com/apidoc/1.12/classes/Zend_View_Abstract.html#method_addFilterPath) or [`setFilterPath()`](https://framework.zend.com/apidoc/1.12/classes/Zend_View_Abstract.html#method_setFilterPath) on your `Zend_View` instance from your `Zend_Controller_Action` class. Pass in a path to the directory to contain your output filter classes and a naming prefix that all of your output filter classes will use. I'm not sure why the class prefix defaults to `Zend_View_Filter_` since no such classes exist. In my opinion, it would have made more sense to derive the prefix based on the provided directory path. Anyway, create the directory you've specified if it doesn't already exist and create a new class file within that directory. In my case, I named the directory `Vendor/View/Filter`, the file `Minify.php`, and the class contained in the file `Vendor_View_Filter_Minify`.

Within this class, you must implement at least one method, `filter()`. This method should accept a single parameter, which will be a string containing the view ouput to be filtered, and should return the filtered version of that string. Optionally, if your filter requires access to the related `Zend_View` instance, you can also declare a `setView()` method that accepts the `Zend_View` instance as its only parameter, and it will automatically be passed in when your output filter class is instantiated. Within `setView()`, you can store the `Zend_View` instance in an instance property of the output filter class so it can be referred to later in the `filter()` method.

Once you've finished your output filter class, you need to explicitly add it to the output filters in use from your `Zend_Controller_Action` class. You can use [`addFilter()`](https://framework.zend.com/apidoc/1.12/classes/Zend_View_Abstract.html#method_addFilter) or [`setFilter()`](https://framework.zend.com/apidoc/1.12/classes/Zend_View_Abstract.html#method_setFilter) for this. Pass in the name of your output filter class without the class prefix. In my case, I passed in `'Minify'`. At this point, the filter should be used when rendering your page. I poked around in the DOM and Tidy PHP extension documentation, but couldn't find a feature for markup minification, so I ended up using the PCRE extension to do the job. Below is the final source code for my output filter class.

```php
// Vendor/View/Filter/Minify.php
class Vendor_View_Filter_Minify
{
    public function filter($string)
    {
        return preg_replace(
            array('/>\s+/', '/\s+</', '/\[\\x0A\\x0D\]+/'),
            array('>', '<', ' '),
            $string
        );
    }
}
```

```php
// Vendor/Controller.php
class Vendor_Controller extends Zend_Controller_Action
{
    public function init()
    {
        $this->_helper->layout->getLayoutInstance()->getView()
            ->addFilterPath('Vendor/View/Filter', 'Vendor_View_Filter_')
            ->addFilter('Minify');
    }
}
```
