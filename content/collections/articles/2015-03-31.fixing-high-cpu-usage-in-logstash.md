I blogged previously about [our Logstash installation](/2014/06/18/centralized-logging-with-monolog-logstash-and-elasticsearch/). Some time after we’d set it up, we noticed the CPU usage on the Logstash server was constantly at or near 100%, even with only minor load. Unfortunately, this wasn’t the type of issue that was easy to google for and it took some time to track down a working solution, so I thought I’d share it here.

The source of the solution ended up being [a thread](http://web.archive.org/web/20150522063456/https://groups.google.com/d/msg/logstash-users/cgOIqxr_J4g) on a Google Group for Logstash users. The issue seemed to be that the logstash-web service was continuously trying and failing to bind to its TCP port, which may have been due to the port lockdown that was part of our [ElasticSearch vulnerability response](/2014/08/13/elasticsearch-vulnerability/).

Since we weren’t actually using the logstash-web service, the simplest solution seemed to be what the thread suggested: shut the service down and configure it not to start automatically. Per [this message](http://web.archive.org/web/20150522063456/https://groups.google.com/d/msg/logstash-users/cgOIqxr_J4g/0zksh_Fcjc8J) in the thread, this was as easy as running these commands:

```bash
sudo service logstash-web stop
echo manual | sudo tee /etc/init/logstash-web.override
```

Once we did this, our CPU usage dropped off immensely, as shown in the screenshot below.

Hope this solution helps others. Thanks for reading!
